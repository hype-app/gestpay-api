### Encrypt Example: EPS

> EPS example: 

```xml
<Encrypt>
  <shopLogin>90000001</shopLogin>
  <uicCode>242</uicCode><!-- Euro -->
  <amount>0.10</amount>
  <shopTransactionId>MYSHOP_001</shopTransactionId>
  <paymentTypes>
    <paymentType>S2PEPS</paymentType>
  </paymentTypes>
</Encrypt>
```

EPS does not need mandatory parameters. 

You must use `S2PEPS` as `paymentType`.

More informations about EPS are [in the doc]( <%= config[:doc_url] %>/oth/eps.html).
