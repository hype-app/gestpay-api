#### Enabling Paypal 

> If you only specify `PAYPAL` payment type, Axerve E-commerce Solutions won't show the payment page but will redirect directly to Paypal's payment page: 

```xml
<Encrypt>
  <shopLogin>9000001</shopLogin>
  <uicCode>242</uicCode>
  <amount>985</amount>
  <shopTransactionId>34az85ord19</shopTransactionId> 
  <paymentTypes>
    <paymentType>PAYPAL</paymentType>
  </paymentTypes>
<Encrypt>
```

####Â Paypal recurring payments 

> In this way you can activate recurring payments on paypal. Note that no `paymentType` is needed. 

```xml
<Encrypt>
  <shopLogin>9000001</shopLogin>
  <uicCode>242</uicCode>
  <amount>985</amount>
  <shopTransactionId>34az85ord19</shopTransactionId> 
  <payPalBillingAgreementDescription>
    description of the agreement 
  </payPalBillingAgreementDescription>
<Encrypt>
```

A Buyer will be able to subscribe a Billing Agreement on PayPal website so authorizing the Merchant to debit his/her PayPal account in future transactions.

To use PayPal Reference Transaction it's necessary to fill the tag `PayPalBillingAgreementDescription` that can be present or not (in case of a normal PayPal payment it will be left empty or not passed at all).


| Name | max length | description |
| ---- | :--------: | ----------- |
| `payPalBillingAgreementDescription` | 127 | Description of the goods, terms and conditions of the billing agreement |

The Encryption service, if field `payPalBillingAgreementDescription` is present and not empty, assumes that the payment method is PayPal (so `paymentType` field in this case is **not mandatory**: if present it must be valued `PAYPAL`).

If this tag is passed to Encryption, Axerve E-commerce Solutions bypasses the Pagam page in every case (even if other payment methods are enabled for the Merchant).

This tag has to be filled with description of the goods, terms and conditions of the billing agreement.
