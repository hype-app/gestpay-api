## Decrypt result 

> GestPay authenticates the calling server and checks the encrypted data string. If the checks are passed, it returns an unencrypted data string containing the transaction result: 

```xml
 <DecryptResult>
  <GestPayCryptDecrypt xmlns="">
    <TransactionType>DECRYPT</TransactionType>
    <TransactionResult>OK</TransactionResult>
    <ShopTransactionID>34az85ord19</ShopTransactionID>
    <BankTransactionID>656</BankTransactionID>
    <AuthorizationCode>983RT4</AuthorizationCode>
    <Currency>242</Currency>
    <Amount>985.40</Amount>
    <ErrorCode>0</ErrorCode>
    <ErrorDescription>Transazione correttamente effettuata</ErrorDescription>
  </GestPayCryptDecrypt>
</DecryptResult>
```

A transaction result can be interpreted by verifying the `TransactionResult` field value. The possible values are:

|Transaction Result | Description | 
| ----------------- | ----------- | 
| `OK` | Positive transaction result | 
| `KO` | Negative transaction result | 
| `XX` | Suspended transaction result. This is not a final result: Gestpay will send `XX` when the outcome is asynchronous. Right now these systems are `MyBank`, `Sofort`, `IDeal`, `Bank Transfer`. In the future, this code might be returned with other payment systems (bitcoins, for example). <br/> A new communication will be provided to the merchant when the transaction will assume the final `OK`/`KO` status. <br/> **If you receive a `XX` code, don't send your goods but wait to receive the actual payment.** The customer with `XX` transaction is redirect to URL for positive response.   |
