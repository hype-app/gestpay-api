## How read documentation

The notation `{...}` means that are required the value of certain type. For example, for every REST call you must provide a header with your merchant apikey, so this notation

| Header          | Value                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `Authorization` | `apikey "{merchant Api Key}"` |

means the header should look like 

`Authorization: apikey d3h8273gd87g8h34d78438dv4783d3874f`
